## Simple Search

### Intro

The search is one of the most common and fundamental features of just about any website or app.  The List Filter and Pagination project has a Search feature "Extra Credit" option.  Here’s some lightweight practice using a simple form to search for matches in a table of names.  You’ll use JavaScript to highlight matches as values are typed into the search field and when the `Submit` button is clicked.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, typing and deleting letters to and from the Search input field should highlight table cells that match, and if ned be, un-highlight the ones that don't.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
